# Support_vector_machine

A support vector machine is a machine learning model that is able to generalise between two different classes if the set of labelled data is provided in the training set to the algorithm. The main function of the SVM is to check for that hyperplane that is able to distinguish between the two classes.

In this notebook, I used SVM(**Support Vector Machines**) to build and train a model using human cell records, and classified cells to whether the samples are benign or malignant.
